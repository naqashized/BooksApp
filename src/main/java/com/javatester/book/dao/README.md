# Exercise 4: Implementing `BookService`

For this exercise you must implement the `BookService` interface, which defines
methods for getting and deleting books from a relational database. A detailed
description of the structure of the tables in this relational database is given
below (see Database Tables).

## What Is Provided:
1. This README.md file.
2. The BookService interface - DO NOT MODIFY!
3. The BookServiceTest JUnit - DO NOT MODIFY!
4. The BookDB class          - DO NOT MODIFY!

## What You Must Do:
1. Create a class named BookServiceImpl that implements the BookService interface.
2. Make sure there is a no-arg constructor for BookServiceImpl.
3. The tables of the relational database are described in the comments of
   the BookDB class and below (see Database Tables).
   
## Dependencies
`PersonImpl`
`BookImpl`
   
## Additional Information

The `BookDB` represents an embedded in-memory relational database. Your
soulution must use this class to initialize the database before executing any
SQL. To use this class, all you need to do is call `BookDB.getInstance()`. This
will start up the database, create the required database tables, populate the
tables with data, and return a singleton `BookDB` instance. The `BookDB` can
then be used directly or indirectly to connect to the database. Here is the
information you will need to connect to the database:

	1. General connection data:

			URL:		"jdbc:derby:memory:BookDB;create=true"
			Username:	"user1"
			Password:	"user1"
		
	2. To get a javax.sql.DataSource, call BookDB.getDataSource();

	3. To get a javax.sql.Connection, call BookDB.getConnection();
	
## Database Tables
There are three database tables you need to access:

	1. Book
	2. Person
	3. Genre
	
Here are the SQL create table statement for these tables:

    create table book (
        title varchar(50),
        isbn bigint,
        author int,
        genre int,
        pages int,
        published date,
        primary key (isbn),
        foreign key (author) references Person(id),
        foreign key (genre) references genre(id)
    )

    create table person (
        id int,
        firstName varchar(25),
        lastName varchar(25),
        born date,
        primary key (id)
    )

    create table genre (
        id int,
        name varchar(25),
        primary key (id)
    )

Finally, here's the logical data model:

                                                  +------------------------+
                                                  | PERSON                 |
    +-------------------------+                   +------------------------+
    | BOOK                    |                   | firstName  varchar(25) |
    +-------------------------+                   | lastName   varchar(25) |
    |                         |                   | born       date        |
    | author    int    (FK) +-------------------> | id         int    (PK) |
    | title     varchar(50)   |                   +------------------------+
    | isbn      bigint (PK)   |                
    | born      date          |          +-------------------+
    | pages     int           |          | GENRE             |
    | published date          |          +-------------------+
    | genre     int    (FK) +----------> | id    int    (PK) |
    |                         |          | name  varchar(25) |
    +-------------------------+          +-------------------+
