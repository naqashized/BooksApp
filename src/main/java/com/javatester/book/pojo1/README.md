# Exercise 1: Implementing `Person`

For this exercise you must implement a simple interface called `Person`, which
only has three fields. In addition you must ensure there is a no argument
constructor and also override the `equals()` method from the `Object` class.

## What Is Provided:
1. This README.md file.
2. The Person interface - DO NOT MODIFY!
3. The PersonTest JUnit - DO NOT MODIFY!

## What You Must Do:
1. Create a class named PersonImpl that implements the Person interface.
2. Make sure there is a no-arg constructor for PersonImpl.
3. Override the equals method to test for equality. Two Person instances
   are only equal if they have exactly the same name (first and last) and
   birth date.
