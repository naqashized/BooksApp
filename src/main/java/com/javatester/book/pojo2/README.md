# Exercise 2: Implementing `Book`

For this exercise you must implement the `Book` interface. In addition you must
ensure that there is a no argument constructor and also override the `equals()`
method from the `Object` class.

## What Is Provided:
1. This README.md file.
2. The Book interface - DO NOT MODIFY!
3. The BookTest JUnit - DO NOT MODIFY!

## What You Must Do:
1. Create a class named BookImpl that implements the Book interface.
2. Make sure there is a no-arg constructor for BookImpl.
3. Override the equals method to test for equality. Two Book instances
   are only equal if they have exactly the same ISBN.
